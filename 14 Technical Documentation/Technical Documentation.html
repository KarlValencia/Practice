            Innates are abilities that are present on the hero for the entire game, from the very beginning of every match. Every hero has a unique Innate.
          </p>
          <code>
            Some Innates grant a hero a unique effect. For example, Dawnbreaker reveals the whole map to allies when the sun rises.
          </code>
          <code>
            Other Innates change a hero ability to have five levels and get a free ability point at level 1. For example, Kunkka's Tidebringer now starts at level 1, and can still be upgraded four more times like normal.

            Facets are a hero customization choice that provide the ability to better align the playstyle of a hero with a specific match or player preference. Facets are specific to heroes: Each hero has at least two Facets, and every player can choose the Facet they prefer during strategy time at the beginning of each match.
          </p>
          <code>
            Viper can choose between adding an AoE damage burst to Poison Attack, or increasing defensive buffs while Viper remains in Nethertoxin.
          </code>
          <code>
            Wraith King can choose between summoning skeletons, or dealing additional curse damage when attacking.

            <p>
This update introduces two new mechanics for each hero: Innate abilities and Facets</p>
          </ul>
          <h3>Innate Abilities</h3>
          <p>Innates are abilities that are present on the hero for the entire game, from the very beginning of every match. Every hero has a unique Innate</p>
          <p>The Innate for each hero can be viewed on the Hero page, or in-game by hovering a new icon between the hero talents and abilities</p>
          <p>There are two types of Innates:
            <ul>
              <li>Some Innates grant a hero a unique effect. For example, Faceless Void slows enemy attack projectiles within range, and Dawnbreaker reveals the whole map to allies when the sun rises</li>
              <li>Some Innates change a hero ability to have five levels and get a free ability point at level 1. For example, Kunkka's Tidebringer and Legion Commander's Moment of Courage now start at level 1, and can still be upgraded four more times like normal</li>   
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Facets</h3>
          <p>Facets are a hero customization choice that provide the ability to better align the playstyle of a hero with a specific match or player preference. Facets are specific to heroes: Each hero has at least two Facets, and every player can choose the Facet they prefer during strategy time at the beginning of each match</p>
          <p>Hero Facets can be viewed on their hero page, below the hero name and tags. They can also be viewed in-game by hovering a new icon between the hero talent and abilities, on the scoreboard, or on the top bar when holding Alt</p>
          <p>Facets are set for all players after the strategy time, and cannot be changed during a match. Facet choices aren't revealed to the enemy team until after the game begins</p>
          <p>
            Facets can have a variety of effects, for example:
            <ul>
              <li>
Viper can choose between adding an AoE damage burst to Poison Attack, or increasing defensive buffs while Viper remains in Nethertoxin</li>
              <li>Wraith King can choose between summoning skeletons, or dealing additional curse damage when attacking</li>
              <li>Leshrac can choose between his attacks restoring mana, or changing Diabolic Edict to explode faster but deal no damage to buildings</li>
              <li>Lone Druid can choose between an improved Spirit Link, granting lifesteal in both directions, or allowing True Form to be cast on the Spirit Bear</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
